The mobility data v1 (2020-2021) was originally released by the [Ministry of Transport and Sustainable Mobility (MITMA)](https://www.transportes.gob.es/) [@mitma_data_v1]. The dataset is produced by [Nommon](https://www.nommon.es/){target="_blank"} using the raw data from [Orange España](https://www.orange.es/){target="_blank"}. Even though the raw data is only from one mobile phone operator, the resulting flows and and other counts of number of individuals in the data set are already resampled to be representative of the total population of Spain. The tables in the data set provide hourly flows between zones across Spain for every day of the observation period (2020-02-14 to 2021-05-09) and the number of trips per person made. This document will introduce you to the available data and provide brief code snippets on how to access it using the `spanishoddata` R package.

**Note: Kindly consult the documents above for any specific details on the methodology. The codebook here is only a simplified summary.**

To access any data in this codebook, please do the following:

Install `spanishoddata` R package:

```{r}
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Robinlovelace/spanishoddata")
```

Set the cache folder for the package to download the files into. You may need up to 30 GB to download all data and another 30 GB if you would like to convert the downloaded data into analysis ready format (a `DuckDB` database file, or a folder of `parquet` files). You can find more info on this conversion in the [Converting the data for faster analysis](#convert-data).

```{r}
library(spanishoddata)
Sys.setenv(SPANISH_OD_DATA_DIR = "/path/to/your/cache/directory")
```

# Overall approach to working with data

The @fig-overall-flow presents the overall approach to accessing the data in the `spanishoddata` package.

# 1. Spatial data with zoning boundaries

The base zoning of the study ([`Distrtics`](#districts)) is made up of census districts in cities and municipalities in the rest of Spain. In areas with low populations, data from nearby areas is aggregated to comply with Data Protection regulations. Based on this base zoning, another zoning at the municipal level ([`Municipalities`](#municipalities)) is generated, including aggregations of municipalities for data protection.

## 1.1 `Districts` {#districts}

`Districts` consist of 2850 zones (compared to 10494 census districts they are based on). In urban areas you get some level of detail within cities. In rural areas, one district is often equal to a municipality, but municipalities with low population are combined into larger units to preserve privacy of individuals in the dataset.

To access it:

```{r}
districts_v1 <- spod_get_zones("dist", ver = 1)
```

The `districts_v1` object is of class `sf` consisting of polygons.

Data structure:

| Variable Name | **Description** |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `id` | District `id` assigned by the data provider. Matches with `id_origin`, `id_destination`, and `id` in district level [origin-destination data](#od-data) and [trips per person data](#tpp-data). |
| `census_districts` | A list of census district identifiers as classified by the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) that are spatially bound within polygons with `id` above. |
| `municipalities_mitma` | A list of municipality identifiers as assigned by the data provider in municipality zones spatial dataset that correspond to a given district `id` . |
| `municipalities` | A list of municipality identifiers as classified by the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) that correspond to polygons with `id` above. |
| `district_names_in_v2` | A list of names of district polygons defined in the v2 version of this data that covers the year 2022 and onwards that correspond to polygons with `id` above. **TODO: insert link to v2 codebook.** |
| `district_ids_in_v2` | A list of identifiers of district polygons defined in the v2 version of this data that covers the year 2022 and onwards that correspond to polygons with `id` above. **TODO: insert link to v2 codebook.** |

## 1.2 `Municipalities` {#municipalities}

`Municipalities` consist of 2205 zones (compared to 8125 municipalities they are based on). Same as above, but without any spatial detalisation in the cities.

To access it:

```{r}
municipalities_v1 <- spod_get_zones("muni", ver = 1)
```

The resulting `municipalities_v1` object is type `sf` consisting of polygons.

Data structure:

| Variable Name | **Description** |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `id` | District `id` assigned by the data provider. Matches with `id_origin`, `id_destination`, and `id` in municipality level [origin-destination data](#od-data) and [trips per person data](#tpp-data). |
| `municipalities` | A list of municipality identifiers as classified by the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) that correspond to polygons with `id` above. |
| `districts_mitma` | A list of district identifiers as assigned by the data provider in districts zones spatial dataset that correspond to a given municipality `id` . |
| `census_districts` | A list of census district identifiers as classified by the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) that are spatially bound within polygons with `id` above. |
| `municipality_names_in_v2` | A list of names of municipality polygons defined in the v2 version of this data that covers the year 2022 and onwards that correspond to polygons with `id` above. **TODO: insert link to v2 codebook.** |
| `municipality_ids_in_v2` | A list of identifiers of municipality polygons defined in the v2 version of this data that covers the year 2022 and onwards that correspond to polygons with `id` above. **TODO: insert link to v2 codebook.** |

The spatial data you get via `spanishoddata` package is downloaded directly from the source, the geometries of polygons are automatically fixed if there are any invalid geometries. The zone identifiers are stored in `id` column. Apart from that `id` column, the the original zones files do not have any metadata. However, as seen above, using the `spanishoddata` package you get many additional columns that provide a semantic connection between official statistical zones used by the Spanish government and the zones you can get for the v2 data (for 2022 onward).

# 2. Mobility data

All mobility data is referenced via `id_origin`, `id_destination`, or other location identifiers (mostly labelled as `id`) with the two sets of zones described above.

## 2.1. Origin-destination data {#od-data}

The origin-destination data contain the number of trips between `districts` or `municipalities` in Spain for every hour of every day between 2020-02-14 and 2021-05-09. Each flow also has attributes such as the trip purpose (composed of the type of activity at both the origin and destination), province of residence of individuals making this trip, distance covered while making the trip. See the detailed attributes below in a table. @fig-flows-barcelona shows an example of total flows in the province of Barcelona on Feb 14th, 2020.

![Origin destination flows in Barcelona on 2020-02-14](media/flows_plot.svg){#fig-flows-barcelona width="70%"}

Here are the variables you can find in both the `district` and `municipality` level origin-destination data:

| **English Variable Name** | **Original Variable Name** | Type | **Description** |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| `date` | `fecha` | `Date` | The date of the recorded data, formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`. |
| `id_origin` | `origen` | `factor` | The origin zone `id` of `district` or `municipalitity`. |
| `id_destination` | `destino` | `factor` | The destination zone `id` of `district` or `municipalitity`. |
| `activity_origin` | `actividad_origen` | `factor` | The type of activity at the origin zone, recoded from `casa`, `otros`, `trabajo_estudio` to `home`, `other`, `work_or_study` respectively. |
| `activity_destination` | `actividad_destino` | `factor` | The type of activity at the destination zone, similarly recoded as for `activity_origin` above. |
| `residence_province_ine_code` | `residencia` | `factor` | The province code of residence if individuals who were making the trips in `n_trips`, encoded as province codes as classified by the Spanish Statistical Office (INE). |
| `residence_province_name` | Derived from `residencia` | `factor` | The full name of the residence province, derived from the province code above. |
| `time_slot` | `periodo` | `integer` | The time slot during which the trips occurred. |
| `distance` | `distancia` | `factor` | The distance range of the trip, categorized into specific intervals such as `0005-002` (500 m to 2 km), `002-005` (2-5 km), `005-010` (5-10km), `010-050` (10-50 km), `050-100` (50-100 km), and `100+` (more than 100 km). |
| `n_trips` | `viajes` | `numeric` | The number of trips for that specific origin-destination pair and time slot. |
| `trips_total_length_km` | `viajes_km` | `numeric` | The total length of trips in kilometers, summing up all trips between the origin and destination zones. |
| `year` | `year` | `integer` | The year of the recorded data, extracted from the date. |
| `month` | `month` | `integer` | The month of the recorded data, extracted from the date. |
| `day` | `day` | `integer` | The day of the recorded data, extracted from the date. |

**Data transformation note**

The original data is stored in the [`maestra-1`](https://www.transportes.gob.es/ministerio/proyectos-singulares/estudios-de-movilidad-con-big-data/estudios-de-movilidad-anteriores/covid-19/opendata-movilidad){target="_blank"} folder with suffixes `distritos` (for district zoning) and `municipios` (for municipality zoning). We only use the `district` level data because of several data issues with the `municipality` data documented [here](http://www.ekotov.pro/mitma-data-issues/issues/011-v1-tpp-mismatch-zone-ids-in-table-and-spatial-data.html){target="_blank"} and [here](http://www.ekotov.pro/mitma-data-issues/issues/012-v1-tpp-district-files-in-municipality-folders.html){target="_blank"}, but also because the distric level data contains more columns with useful origin-destination flow characteristics. As a result, you get both the `district` level data and the `municipality` level data with the same columns. `Municipality` level data is simply a re-aggregation of `district` level data using the official relations file where `district` identifiers are mapped to `municipality` identifiers (orginal file is [`relaciones_distrito_mitma.csv`](https://opendata-movilidad.mitma.es/relaciones_distrito_mitma.csv){target="_blank"}).

**Getting the data**

To access the data, use the `spod_get_od()` function. In this example we will use a short interval of dates:

```{r}
dates <- c(start = "2020-02-14", end = "2020-02-17")
od_dist <- spod_get(type = "od", zones = "dist", dates = dates)
od_muni <- spod_get(type = "od", zones = "muni", dates = dates)
```

The data for the specified dates will be automatically downloaded and cached in the `SPANISH_OD_DATA_DIR` directory. Existing files will not be re-downloaded.

**Working with the data**

The resulting objects `od_dist` and `od_muni` are of class `tbl_duckdb_connection`[^1]. Basically, you can treat these as regular `data.frame`s or `tibble`s. One important difference is that the data is not actually loaded into memory, because if you requested more dates, e.g. a whole month or a year, all that data would most likely not fit into your computer's memory. A `tbl_duckdb_connection` is mapped to the downloaded CSV files that are cached on disk and the data is only loaded in small chunks as needed at the time of computation. You can manipulate `od_dist` and `od_muni` using `{dplyr}` functions such as `select()`, `filter()`, `mutate()`, `group_by()`, `summarise()`, etc. In the end of any sequence of commands you will need to add `collect()` to execute the whole chain of data manipulations and load the results into memory in an R `data.frame`/`tibble` like so:

[^1]: For reference: this object also has classes: `tbl_dbi` ,`tbl_sql`, `tbl_lazy` ,and `tbl` .

```{r}
library(dplyr)
od_mean_hourly_trips_over_the_4_days <- od_dist |>
  group_by(time_slot) |>
  summarise(
    mean_hourly_trips = mean(n_trips, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop") |> 
  collect()
od_mean_hourly_trips_over_the_4_days
```

```         
# A tibble: 24 × 2
   time_slot mean_hourly_trips
       <int>             <dbl>
 1        18              21.4
 2        10              19.3
 3         2              14.8
 4        15              19.8
 5        11              19.9
 6        16              19.6
 7        22              20.9
 8         0              18.6
 9        13              21.1
10        19              22.5
# ℹ 14 more rows
# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows
```

In this example above, we calculated mean hourly flows over the 4 days of the requested period. The full data for all 4 days was never loaded into memory all at once. Rather the available memory of the computer was used up to its maximum limit to make that calculation happen, without ever exceeding the available memory limit. This is done transparantly to the user with the help of [`DuckDB`](https://duckdb.org/){target="_blank"} (specifically, with [{duckdb} R package](https://r.duckdb.org/index.html){target="_blank"}).

The same summary operation as provided in the example above can be done with the entire dataset for the full 18 month on a regular laptop with 8-16 GB memory. It will take a bit of time to complete, but it will be done. To speed things up, we will also demonstrate in the end of the document, how the data can be converted to more efficient formats.

***Note**: As long as you use object `od_dist` created with `spod_get_od()` function, it is much quicker to filter the dates by the `year`, `month` and `day` variables, rather than by the `date` variable.* This is because the data for each day is in a separate CSV file located in folders that look like `year=2020/month=2/day=14`. So when filtering by the `date` field, R will have to scan all CSV files comparing the specified date with what is stored inside the file. However, if you query by *`year`, `month` and `day` variables, R only needs to check these against the path to each CSV file, which is much quicker. This caveat is only relevant as long as you use `spod_get_od()` . If you convert (see the [relevant section below](#convert-data)) the downloaded data to a format that it optimized for quick analysis, you can use whichever field you want, it should not affect the performance as much.*

## 2.2. Trips per person data {#tpp-data}

The "trips per person" data shows the number of persons by the number of trips they made from each district or municipality.

|  |  |  |  |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| `date` | `fecha` | `Date` | The date of the recorded data, formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`. |
| `id` | `distrito` | `factor` | The identifier of the `district` or `municipality` zone. |
| `n_trips` | `numero_viajes` | `factor` | The number of trips per person, categorized into `0`, `1`, `2`, or `2+` trips. |
| `n_persons` | `personas` | `factor` | The number of persons making the trips from `district` or `municipality` with zone `id`. |
| `year` | `year` | `integer` | The year of the recorded data, extracted from the date. |
| `month` | `month` | `integer` | The month of the recorded data, extracted from the date. |
| `day` | `day` | `integer` | The day of the recorded data, extracted from the date. |

To access it use `spod_get()` with `type` set to "trips_per_persons", or just "tpp". We can also set `dates` to the maximum possible date range `2020-02-14` to `2021-05-09` to get all the data, as this data is relatively small (under 200 Mb).

```{r}
dates <- c(start = "2020-02-14", end = "2021-05-09")
tpp_dist <- spod_get(type = "trips_per_person", zones = "dist", dates = dates)
```

Because this data is small, we can actually load it completely into memory:

```{r}
tpp_dist_tbl <- tpp_dist |> dplyr::collect()
```
